## An educational tool for exploring the ECO32 CPU-architecture

This tool is based on the ECO32 User Manual by Martin Geisse (https://homepages.thm.de/~hg53/eco32-on-s3e/eco32.pdf) provided by the Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen.

The finished software is expected to include a virtual machine and runtime environment for the ECO32 architecture, tools for debugging programs, and functions to tinker with the processor to better understand the mechanisms behind it.

The project is currently in early development; the release of the first executable version will take some time.
